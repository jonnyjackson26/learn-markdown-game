/**
 * Analytics Reports Utility
 * 
 * This file contains utility functions to help analyze user progress through the tutorial.
 * These functions are not used in the application itself but provide guidance on querying
 * Firebase Analytics data to understand user behavior.
 */

/**
 * Example Firebase Analytics query to measure funnel progression through tutorial levels
 * 
 * This query would identify what percentage of users complete each level, showing where
 * users might be dropping off in the tutorial.
 * 
 * In Firebase Analytics Console:
 * 1. Create a custom "Funnel" report
 * 2. Set the first step as "start_game" event
 * 3. Add subsequent steps using "level_completed" event with level_number parameter
 * 4. Set appropriate time window (e.g., 30 days)
 */

/**
 * Example query to identify the most challenging levels
 * 
 * Look for levels where users spend significantly more time than average
 * or where completion rate drops sharply.
 * 
 * In Firebase Analytics Console:
 * 1. Create a custom "User Properties" report
 * 2. Examine "level_completed" events
 * 3. Break down by "level_number" and "time_spent" parameters
 * 4. Sort by average time_spent to identify challenging levels
 */

/**
 * Example query to track overall tutorial completion rate
 * 
 * This helps understand what percentage of users who start the tutorial
 * actually complete all levels.
 * 
 * In Firebase Analytics Console:
 * 1. Compare count of "start_game" events to count of "milestone_level_reached" 
 *    events with the final level number
 * 2. Calculate the ratio to determine completion percentage
 */

/**
 * Sample BigQuery SQL for analyzing level completion times
 * 
 * If exporting Firebase Analytics data to BigQuery, this query can help
 * analyze how much time users spend on each level.
 * 
 * ```sql
 * SELECT
 *   event_params.value.int_value AS level_number,
 *   AVG(event_params.value.int_value) AS avg_time_spent
 * FROM
 *   `your-project-id.analytics_XXXXXX.events_*`,
 *   UNNEST(event_params) AS event_params
 * WHERE
 *   event_name = 'level_completed'
 *   AND event_params.key = 'time_spent'
 * GROUP BY
 *   level_number
 * ORDER BY
 *   level_number ASC
 * ```
 */

/**
 * Sample BigQuery SQL for analyzing user progress by date
 * 
 * This query helps track how far users get in the tutorial on average by date.
 * 
 * ```sql
 * SELECT
 *   DATE(TIMESTAMP_MICROS(event_timestamp)) AS event_date,
 *   MAX(event_params.value.int_value) AS max_level_reached,
 *   COUNT(DISTINCT user_pseudo_id) AS user_count
 * FROM
 *   `your-project-id.analytics_XXXXXX.events_*`,
 *   UNNEST(event_params) AS event_params
 * WHERE
 *   event_name = 'milestone_level_reached'
 *   AND event_params.key = 'level_number'
 * GROUP BY
 *   event_date, user_pseudo_id
 * ORDER BY
 *   event_date DESC
 * ```
